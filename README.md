# ModbusTCP data extraction
This code uses pyModbusTCP library to communicate with a Modbus device, read input registers and then perform bit manipulation and conversion of the read values into floating-point numbers.

Regarding the experiments conducted with Modbus, an article has been published in the [Sensors](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/12/5694) journal, evaluating the performance and usability complexity of various industrial protocols from a software perspective.
